My name is Sviatoslav Humeniuk. I'm a student at the Artificial Intelligence Systems Department, group ShI-23.
I specialize in web development, primarily using C#, and enjoy building practical applications.
In addition to that, I'm deeply interested in machine learning and cloud technologies, and I actively explore these fields as part of my academic and personal projects.
